  ## Introduction
  
  Updated again, for the 3rd time!
  Way too fast. AI is advancing at a pace that is hard to keep up with. This essay explores the implications of this rapid advancement and how we can adapt.
  In our fast-paced digital world, design often prioritizes efficiency and engagement metrics over thoughtful user experiences. This essay explores how principles of mindfulness can transform our approach to design.
  
  ## What is Mindful Design?
  
  Mindful design is an approach that brings awareness and intention to every decision in the design process. It asks us to slow down and consider the broader impact of our work.
  
  ## Key Principles
  
  ### 1. Present-Moment Awareness
  
  By focusing on the current step of the design process rather than rushing to completion, designers can discover innovative solutions that might otherwise be missed.
  
  ### 2. Non-Judgment
  
  Suspending judgment during ideation phases allows for a broader range of creative possibilities.
  
  ### 3. Compassion
  
  Designing with empathy and compassion means truly considering the emotional impact of our work on users.
  
  ## Practical Applications
  
  When applied to user interface design, mindfulness principles might lead to:
  
  \`\`\`css
  .mindful-interface {
    distractions: minimal;
    user-control: maximum;
    attention-demands: conscious;
  }
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  By incorporating mindfulness into our design practice, we create not just more effective products, but more meaningful and ethical ones.`

  yesterday, someone asked what I liked to do. 

  I gave a vague, half-baked answer. the kind of answer you cook up at an exam you haven’t studied for.

  so, I wanted to try to define my interests more concretely. (I still dislike summarizing myself though, you’ll notice why.)

  this essay could probably be replaced with the following sentence: _I like doing what I find interesting in that particular moment._

  you can stop reading now.

  unless, you’re really curious…

  I would divide my interests into two main parts:

  **learning** and **creating**.

  ## learning

  people often associate the word learning with school. I find it unfortunate because it leads people astray, and it gives the word a goofy vibe. 

  I like to learn about what interests me. this is not to be confused with learning what I am told I should learn. if you separate the two, I think you will find more joy in learning new things. 

  my interests vary a lot, often depending on my mood. I could be curious about cooking one week and AI agents the next week. I’m not sure how common that is. 

  technology is often the common thread though. if not that, I might find myself exploring nutrition, exercise, philosophy, anatomy, or evolution. I’ve also been enjoying biographies more lately. 

  I think the best entrance to learning is reading. listening and watching work too, but they’re slower. the more I read on my own, the more I enjoy it. I don’t think that’s an accident. learning seems to stick when I apply it, so I try to use whatever I learn. 

  for instance, immortal and genderless animals recently fascinated me (I had no idea such animals exist?!). I spent a couple evening walks discussing the matter with GPT 4o voice mode. it was an unexpectedly pleasant experience lol. to make it stick, I talked about it with my dad. applying knowledge (discussing it in this case) often reveals gaps in what you think you know. 

  I find the key is not rejecting what interests me. I try to keep this top of mind. whatever I am curious about, I want to figure it out on the spot, **before it slips away.** 

  ## creating

  creating is a bit more abstract. I think of it as output, or applied learning. 

  I was **building** Legos at the age of 5, and by 12 I was into editing and **creating** YouTube videos. through uploading videos, I was **creating** a community online. I soon got into coding and **building** small sandbox games and websites. this website, even this essay, is a **creation**. 

  I always liked creating stuff. more importantly nowadays, I want whatever I create to be a natural byproduct of me doing “me”.

  writing is my favourite form of output. there is something oddly pleasant in putting one’s thoughts to paper. coding ranks just below. 

  the more sophisticated version of creating is problem solving. in my opinion, this is the more interesting form. this means creating something *to solve a problem*. 

  interesting problems are tangible. there is no fun in trying to solve climate change or world peace, because it’s almost impossible to know if what you’re doing is working. the feedback loops are too slow. the way to recognize that a problem is tangible is that (a) the effort impacts real people, and (b) it has tight feedback loops. I want to see progress and iterate.

  attempting to solve tangible problems gives me a sense of fulfilment. each step toward the goal, which usually brings a trail of new problems and ideas, is oddly pleasant. 

  ## bonus

  there are a couple niche interests I did not mention/fit above. mainly because they’re not as predominant.

  **health** is one of them. eating healthy and exercising is satisfying to me. it seems like a chore to most people. my family sees it as a tedious task whenever I weigh my food. I suspect I don’t see it as that because there is a tight feedback loop. there’s a clear feedback loop, and I can see my progress each week. it’s fascinating. hehe. < link to sheet

  **food** and **cooking** are also things I enjoy (I am very petty about my diet though lol). cooking and vibing to music is so underrated.

  as you’ve probably noticed, i **think** a lot. sometimes more than I’d like to. I don’t think that’s an interest. feels more like how I’m wired. but, since I’m listing interests that fill my spare time, I might as well include thinking. it’s led to more walks and alone time, which I’ve been prioritizing lately. 

  the **ocean** is another niche interest. I never went on vacation without bringing snorkeling equipment as a kid. watching fish was just *that* important. there was something cozy about their lives, lurking through coral leaves as if they were alleys of their little town.

  what fascinates me nowadays about the ocean is that so much of it is unexplored. yet, inside the tiny explored part we’ve found some crazy species: species that can reverse aging on demand, change gender, or literally clone themselves. and I’m supposed to believe aliens don’t exist?

  the end.`

  what a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/).
  I told you don't press this essay... Why did you press it?
  
  ## Current State of Remote Work
  
  In 2023, many companies have adopted hybrid models, while others have gone fully remote or returned to office-first policies.
  
  ## Numbered List with Smaller Titles
  
  ### 1. Location-Independent Compensation
  
  Pay scales will gradually decouple from headquarters locations, creating more geographic flexibility.
  
  ### 2. Number Includes Some Code
  
  Future work will increasingly happen asynchronously, with communication designed around this principle:
  
  \`\`\`python
  def async_workflow(team):
      documentation = create_clear_documentation()
      communication = prioritize_written_updates()
      meetings = minimize_and_record()
      
      return improved_work_life_balance
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Some Sort of List
  
  - Equity and inclusion
  - Work-life boundaries
  - Social connection
  - Training and mentorship
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  You've just wasted a couple seconds of your life that you will never get back. Congratulations.`
